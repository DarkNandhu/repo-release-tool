# Release Tool

A GitHub Action to create a tag and release for your project. This action configures Git and automates the process of creating a release on GitHub. It works for Node.js and Dart projects and will tag the code to the version provided in `package.json` or `pubspec.yml`. After tagging the version, it will push the tag and create a release with a simple release note generated from the commits between the last tag and the current tag.

## How It Works

The action follows these steps:

1. **Setup Git Configuration**:
   - Sets up Git with the necessary configurations using the `setupGit` function in `index.ts`.

2. **Create a Tag**:
   - The `Tag` class in `tag.ts` handles the creation of a new tag based on the version specified in the projectâ€™s configuration file (`package.json` or `pubspec.yml`).

3. **Generate Release Notes**:
   - The `Release` class in `release.ts` generates release notes from the commits between the last tag and the current tag.

4. **Create a Release**:
   - The `Release` class uses the GitHub API to create a release with the generated release notes.

## Usage

To use this action in your workflow, include the following step in your `.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Run Release Tool
        uses: DarkNandhu/repo-release-tool@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          language: 'flutter'
```
